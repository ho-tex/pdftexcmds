# pdftexcmds

pdftexcmds package for LaTeX

LuaTeX provides most of the commands of pdfTeX 1.40. However
a number of utility functions are removed. This package tries to fill
the gap and implements some of the missing primitive using Lua.
Also provides similar wrappers for XeLaTeX and otehr engines that provide
these primitives, under possibly different names.
